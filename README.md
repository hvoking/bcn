# bcn - transversal consulting first collaboration

This is a project created purely with REACT, the interactive javascript libray (also the best)  
it gets the data from a backend server that serves MVT (mapbox vector tiles)

go to the src/components/ path and in here you find two folders
  
  src
    -components
      - main --> the application
      - context --> the data

inside main you have the modules of the application
i use simple names to name this folders, the shorter the better
  main
    - left
    - maps
  
obs: 
  this is not a fixed rule, we can be creative about this stuff, 
  they are to many options, this is the one that i'll be practicing 
  for so long and is the one that works for me, 
  use it for your own benefit and break the rules
